# Implementation of the game Quoridor for LandTiger board

> NOTE: When debugging on the lab's computers with the emulator the colors are different than the originals, this problem does not occur on the board.

The implementation of the game was written using the emulator first and foremost, but was also tested on the board and runs way more smoothly on it. If testing on the board please comment out the `SIMULATOR` define in [main.c](Quoridor/main.c).
